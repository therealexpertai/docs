Import an annotated library It is possible to upload annotated libraries on Platform. To upload a new library, see the dedicated section above. Before uploading the library, an annotated library on your computer has two sub-folders inside it, each one with a specific function: test ann The test sub-folder contains all the text files belonging to the annotated library, while the ann sub-folder contains all the files of the previous sub-folder, but with a different extension, .ann . The main difference is the following: if you open a file located in the ann sub-folder, you will see all the categories that have been annotated in the corresponding text file located in the test sub-folder. You will find the annotations when looking at the documents either in the list view or in the detail view after the upload. Example This is a typical example of what you can find in an .ann file: C1 15000000 C2 20001117 The letter C plus the number\u2014e.g. 1\u2014stand for the first category that you will see in the text in the Documents tab, while the multiple digit number stands for the category ID defined in your taxonomy.

For example, typing $LEM adds a box for a lemma-type element to the search criteria, while typing the pipe character ( | ) adds the OR operator.

The search criterion can be summarized as follows: look for a text containing the lemma granola or the lemma rice or both of them together. Tip If you put the cursor to the right of the search criterion, an AND operator will be automatically appended in order to connect new elements to the criteria. Hint It is possible to change the operator AND into OR and viceversa just by clicking on it. To change the value on an element, just put the cursor inside and edit it. If you delete all the characters inside a box and you press Backspace one more time, the entire box will be removed.

When generating the extraction ML model, the generation algorithm \"learns\" from these examples to give the model the ability to predict similar extractions. Annotations should be created for all the information classes before generating the extraction ML model, according to the principle: \"no annotations, no extractions\". Unlike categorization projects, in which you annotate entire documents with the expected categories, here you need to annotate portions of text. Annotations should also be created in the set of test documents, because they are necessary for a measurement of the extraction quality, that is, if the ML model has actually learned to extract. Annotations are created in the detail view of the Documents tab and are modified in that same view or in the context view, in the same tab. The three views of the Documents tab The Documents tab has three views: The list view, which displays the list of the documents. This is the default view. The Context view, which displays the list of the documents and, for each of them, a list of textual contexts, each one centered on an annotation. You can activate this view from the list view only (see below). Note The context view is activated only when there are annotations. The detail view, which shows a simplified list on the left and the detail of a specific document in the center. Open a document from the list view To switch from the list view to the detail view: Double click a document in the list Or: Select the file name of a document in the list. Or: Select a document in the list and select View document at the top right of the documents list. Switch from list view to context view To switch from the list view to the context view: Select Show context view from the button bar at the top of the documents list. To populate the list: Select the Classes tab in the left panel and: To see all the annotations of a certain class in their context, select the checkbox at the left of the class box. To see all the annotations of the same value in their context: Expand the information class. Select the checkbox at the left of the value box. Repeat the steps above to display more contexts and corresponding documents. Or: Select the Classes tab in the left panel and: To see all the annotations of a certain class in their context, hover over a class and select Context view . To see all the annotations of the same value in their context: Expand the information class. Hover over one of the values in the list and select Context view . Repeat the steps above to display more contexts and corresponding documents. Switch from context view to list view To switch from the context view to the list view, select Show documents view from the button bar at the top of the documents list. Open a document from context view To switch from the context view to the detail view: Select the file name of a document in the list. Or: Select at least one context in the document box in the list and then select View document at the top right of the documents list. Change document in the detail view To change the current document in detail view: Select the document in the left panel Or: Use the Next document and the Previous document buttons located at the top of the document detail panel. Switch from detail view to list view To switch from the detail view to the list view, select Browse documents from the left panel. The basic way to create annotations Annotations are created in the detail view. See above how to open a document in detail view. To annotate a portion of text: Select all the text to be annotated: a pop-up menu appears. Select the information class from the menu. Note Classes marked as favorite are placed at the top of the list and they are recognizable by the star next to the class name. To annotate an occurrence of an entity or token: Use the right panel to highlight occurrences of entities and/or tokens in the text, as you do for corpora . Click the single occurrence of an entity or a token: a pop-up menu appears. Select the information class from the menu. Annotations are listed in the Classes tab of the right panel. Annotation look The annotation chip has two colors: The background color of the short class name on the left is the class color you can set in the Resources tab. The color of the outline of the right part represents quality, that is the outcome of experiments: Purplish blue = FN (False Negative). Green = TP (True Positive). Orange = FP (False Positive). The default color is purplish blue which indicates the annotation is a false negative because it does not\u2014or does not yet\u2014correspond to an extraction. This color is meaningful inside the documents of test libraries and after experiments, when you check extraction results. If, after an experiment, the annotated text is extracted as expected, the outline color will become green, indicating the annotation was matched (true positive). Fast annotation To fast annotate a document in the detail view: Select Toggle fast mode to display the fast annotation toolbar. In the fast annotation toolbar, select the class you want to annotate. Select portions of text or click occurrences of entities and/or tokens you have previously highlighted in the text: all your selections will be annotated in the class you selected in the fast annotation bar. Example If you want to fast annotate all the ingredients in a recipe: In the fast annotation bar, select CTI that is the chip that represents the Ingredients class. Select the ingredients in the document and they will automatically be annotated as ingredients Or: In the right panel, select Tokens , then Lemmas . Select lemma onion that is a potential ingredient, its occurrences will be highlighted in the document. Select the occurrences of the lemma highlighted in the text to annotate them as ingredients . Annotate by propagation To annotate a document by propagation in the detail view: Select an annotation in the text: a pop-up toolbar will appear. Select Propagate on the toolbar. As a result, all the portions of text that are deemed similar to the annotation will tentatively be annotated and the propagation toolbar will be displayed.

In the thesaurus, unlike strictly hierarchical or hyperonymic taxonomies, a more reticular description of knowledge is created.

Curation mode Curation mode shows the effects of curation, it's a preview of the final results. In curation mode, curation controls are disabled. When curation mode is turned off\u2014the default\u2014all the original results are visible and counted, but cured results have markers, red for removed and green for confirmed. When curation mode is turned on: Removed results are not shown. Confirmed results are always shown. Results that have neither been removed nor confirmed may appear or not based on a visualization option. Removal/confirmation markers are not displayed and occurrences counts reflect the number of visible results. To turn curation mode on and off, select Toggle curation mode on the central panel. For example, the picture below shows the curation of extractions when curation mode is turned off. You can see the extraction cheese occurring four times in the text: one occurrence is confirmed (green marker), one has been removed (red marker) and the other two have not been touched (no marker). This is what happens when curation mode is turned on: The removed occurrence of cheese is neither highlighted nor counted anymore, meaning it will not be included in the output. The confirmed occurrence is visible and counted, while the other two are visible and counted too, but they are grayed out. When in curation mode, the Show only curated hits visualization option affects the visibility of original, untouched results. By default the option is not activated, meaning that untouched results are visibile\u2014even if grayed out\u2014and will be included in the output. When the option is activated, original untouched results are not shown anymore and they will not be included in the output. Since removed results are never included in the output, the effect of the activation of the Show only curated hits option is that the output is composed only of confirmed results, if any. To continue with the previous example, here is what happens when Show only curated hits is activated while in curation mode: Thers's only occurence of extraction cheese left and counted, untouched occurrences disappeared. Curation mode and the Show only curated hits option affect categories in the same way. Let's see an example: In the picture above, curation mode is turned off. You see two categories, Soccer and Sport , the former confirmed, the latter untouched. This is what happens when curation mode is turned on: The untouched category is still visible, but it's grayed out. The following picture shows the effect of the activation of Show only curated hits : Only the confirmed category is left. Here's another example with a confirmed category and a removed one. In the picture above, curation mode is off, so you can see both categories with their curation markers. Here's what happens when you turn on curation mode: The removed category is not shown anymore. Nothing will change when activating Show only curated hits , since there are no untouched results. Entities and tokens Entities and tokens are part of the results, but they cannot be curated. Highlight entities To highlight specific entities in the text: Select the Entities tab on the right panel. Expand an entity type. Select the entity. Multiple selection is allowed.

In curation mode, curation controls are disabled. When curation mode is turned off\u2014the default\u2014all the original results are visible and counted, but cured results have markers, red for removed and green for confirmed. When curation mode is turned on: Removed results are not shown. Confirmed results are always shown. Results that have neither been removed nor confirmed may appear or not based on a visualization option. Removal/confirmation markers are not displayed and occurrences counts reflect the number of visible results. To turn curation mode on and off, select Toggle curation mode on the central panel. For example, the picture below shows the curation of extractions when curation mode is turned off. You can see the extraction cheese occurring four times in the text: one occurrence is confirmed (green marker), one has been removed (red marker) and the other two have not been touched (no marker). This is what happens when curation mode is turned on: The removed occurrence of cheese is neither highlighted nor counted anymore, meaning it will not be included in the output. The confirmed occurrence is visible and counted, while the other two are visible and counted too, but they are grayed out. When in curation mode, the Show only curated hits visualization option affects the visibility of original, untouched results. By default the option is not activated, meaning that untouched results are visibile\u2014even if grayed out\u2014and will be included in the output. When the option is activated, original untouched results are not shown anymore and they will not be included in the output. Since removed results are never included in the output, the effect of the activation of the Show only curated hits option is that the output is composed only of confirmed results, if any. To continue with the previous example, here is what happens when Show only curated hits is activated while in curation mode: Thers's only occurence of extraction cheese left and counted, untouched occurrences disappeared. Curation mode and the Show only curated hits option affect categories in the same way. Let's see an example: In the picture above, curation mode is turned off. You see two categories, Soccer and Sport , the former confirmed, the latter untouched. This is what happens when curation mode is turned on: The untouched category is still visible, but it's grayed out. The following picture shows the effect of the activation of Show only curated hits : Only the confirmed category is left. Here's another example with a confirmed category and a removed one. In the picture above, curation mode is off, so you can see both categories with their curation markers. Here's what happens when you turn on curation mode: The removed category is not shown anymore. Nothing will change when activating Show only curated hits , since there are no untouched results.","title":"Curation mode"},{"location":"how-to/workflow/cure-results/#entities-and-tokens","text":"Entities and tokens are part of the results, but they cannot be curated.","title":"Entities and tokens"},{"location":"how-to/workflow/cure-results/#highlight-entities","text":"To highlight specific entities in the text: Select the Entities tab on the right panel.

test libraries In machine learning, training and test sets are used to build the mathematical models capable of making predictions on input data. In the case of Platform, the machine learning models are the text intelligence engines capable of classifying documents and extracting information. The training set is the set of examples that allows the machine learning engine to learn to make predictions. In Platform, the training set is called training library and it contains documents that are annotated with the expected results in terms of classification and extraction. The equivalent of the test set is the test library , also annotated with expected results and used to test the ML model. So, basically, you use a training library to create the ML model and a test library to verify that it has learned. Annotations inside the training set make the machine \"learn\", annotations inside the test library determine prediction quality. One way to produce training sets and test sets is to start from a single larger data set and partition it, typically putting 75% of the documents in the training set and the remaining 25% in the test set. Platform allows you to create other generic libraries at will, for example to use them as validation sets. In these cases, possibly evaluate a different partitioning of the initial dataset, for example 70% for the training library, 15% in a generic library used as a validation test and the other 15% in the test library. When you run an experiment, the object of the experiment itself is the test library. It is there that classification or extraction are carried out and results shown in terms of precision, recall, etc. refer to that library.","title":"Training and test libraries"},{"location":"reference/tt-libraries/#training-and-test-libraries","text":"In machine learning, training and test sets are used to build the mathematical models capable of making predictions on input data.

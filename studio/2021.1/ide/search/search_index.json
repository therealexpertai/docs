Standard domains Semantic analysis categorization Semantic analysis is the preliminary to the application of the categorization and extraction rules. Already during this preliminary, the categorization of a text is carried out and the results are shown in the Standard Domains tab of the Disambiguation Info tool window. This categorization has nothing to do with the one made by rules, but rules can be based on it (see below ). While categorization rules \"produce\" domains from the custom taxonomy, the categorization performed by semantic analysis produces standard domains defined in the Knowledge Graph. Example Considering the text: BMW released Tuesday the details of an electric concept car, with production of the vehicle expected to start in 2021. In an interview with CNBC Tuesday, CEO Oliver Zipse described the BMW Concept i4 vehicle as bringing \"electromobility to the heart of the BMW brand\". \"It's fast, it has an acceleration of less than four seconds from zero to 100 kilometers an hour, it has a range of 600 kilometers (about 373 miles)\", Zipse, who was speaking to CNBC's Annette Weisbach, said. The price is yet to be announced. He went on to note that the company sold more than 140,000 electrified vehicles last year, stating he was \"quite positive about our profitability in the future, even with electromobility\". semantic analysis returns domains such as commerce , motor vehicle , economics . Standard domains derive directly from syncons. Semantic analysis produces a syncon for each noun, verb, adjective or adverb of the analyzed text. Syncons have, among their properties, the association with one or more standard domains. The standard domain list is therefore simply the list of standard domains to which the syncons are associated. Main domains, score and relevance The score of a domain, shown in the Score column, is a function of: The number of syncons associated with that domain. The strength of the syncon-domain association. The score of each associated syncon, which is directly proportional to the frequency of the syncon in the analyzed text. The domains with the highest scores and at least \"n\" associated syncons are considered the main domains, while the others are considered relatively irrelevant, even if they have a high score. The main domains are highlighted in yellow . The relevance of a domain, shown in the Relevance column, is a function of frequency in the text and answers the question: how much is this domain mentioned in the text? This in turn depends on how many of the syncons identified by the disambiguator are associated with the domain. To toggle the display of the relatively irrelevant domains select Toggle Irrelevant Domains on the toolbar. Use standard domains as rule constraint As mentioned above, the results of semantic analysis categorization can be used in categorization and extraction rules. In particular, you can write rules that are triggered only if the text is about a certain topic, i.e. if semantic analysis returns a given standard domain. This condition is called constraint and is specified after the rule's scope. You can write the rule by hand and specify any domain you want or use the results of an analysis to create the template of a generic rule having one of the output domains as its constraint. To create this kind of template and insert it in the file that's current in the editor: Right-click a domain, select Create a rule on domain \"XXXX\" and insert into current rule file and select the rule's scope from the sub-menu. To create the rule template and copy it to the clipboard: Right-click a domain, select Create a rule on domain \"XXXX\" and copy to clipboard and select the rule's scope from the sub-menu. Other commands To copy all domain names to the clipboard, right-click any domain and select Copy all Domains . To copy the names of the relevant domains to the clipboard, right-click any domain and select Copy Relevant Domains . To copy a domain name to the clipboard, right-click the domain and select Copy Domain \"XXXX\" , where XXXX is the domain name. Relevant Information Semantic analysis determines many features of the text, for example the sentences it is composed of, the base form\u2014or lemmas\u2014of the terms, the meaning of the terms, rendered as Knowledge Graph syncons, compound terms recognized heuristically, etc. To these is added the standard domains described above. Of all these output data, some are believed to be more relevant than others. How the main standard domains are determined is described above. Similar mechanisms are used to rank other features and those with higher scores are considered relevant. Relevant information is shown in tab Relevant Information , grouped by type. The Count column shows the number of occurrences and the Score column shows the score. Type commands To highlight the occurrences of all the items of a given type\u2014except domains\u2014select the type. To copy the data of all the items to the clipboard as a list of tab-separated values, right-click any type and select Copy All Relevants Informations .

Categorization and extraction rules are built and act upon this kind of output, so the interpretation of those results for test files is fundamental to understand how to build and tune rules for real texts. Note Semantic Analysis shows the results of the last analysis. If source code or the test file contents change, it is necessary to perform a new analysis. Set the scope The extent of the results displayed in the window is determined by the value of the Scope list on the toolbar. By default it is SENTENCE and the window shows the results for the sentence on which the cursor is located in the test file. To change the scope to paragraph, choose PARAGRAPH from the Scope list. When scope is PARAGRAPH , the window shows the sentences that compose the paragraph separated by a green vertical bar. To show the results for another range of text\u2014sentence or paragraph\u2014, simply select it in the test file. Interpret layers The results of the analysis are represented by layers of colored tiles, which, from top to bottom, correspond to output elements of gradually finer granularity. Layers that are visible by default are: Color Layer Description Sentences Each tile represents a sentence, including final punctuation. Clauses Each tile represents a clause, that is parts of text that are grouped into the smallest grammatical unit that can express a complete proposition. Phrases Each tile represents a phrase, for example noun phrase, verb phrase, etc. Words Each tile corresponds to a word, a collocation or punctuation. Atoms Each tile represents an atom. In the case of a word or punctuation, it corresponds to the word in the layer above, while in case of a collocation, it corresponds to one of the words that compose the collocation. Text elements Each tile represents the portion of text that corresponds to the atom in the layer above. There is an optional layer, whose tiles are colored yellow , which represents the syntactic role\u2014subject, action, object\u2014of the phrases. Note It is possible set different layers color selecting Studio > Studio Settings > Tool Windows > Sematic Analysis Toggle layers Apart from the three lower layers, the other layers can be toggled. To toggle a layer just select the button of the corresponding color on the toolbar. General operations on tiles Show tile details and highlight text Tile details are shown in a dedicated panel on the right of the window. To show tile details and highlight the underlying text inside the test file in the editor, simply select the tile. Copy tile label To copy the tile label: Right-click the tile and choose Copy Label . Show syncon IDs You can show the syncon IDs inside the text elements tiles\u2014white layer\u2014that correspond to concepts identified by the disambiguator. To toggle base syncon ID visibility select Toggle Syncon IDs on the toolbar. To toggle other IDs visibility select Toggle Syncon Multiple IDs on the toolbar. Interpret clause tiles The labels of the tiles in the clause layer represent the clause type: Type Description INDEPENDENT Corresponds to the clause containing both subject and predicate. It can be either a simple sentence or the main clause of a complex sentence that can stand alone. SUBORDINATE Corresponds to any kind of dependent clause that adds information to an independent clause, but which cannot stand alone as a sentence. For example all the clause types listed here excepted INDEPENDENT . RELATIVE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause whose arguments share a referent with a main clause element (introduced by a relative pronoun). NON-FINITE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause whose verb is non-finite. PREPOSITIONAL Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause introduced by a preposition. CAUSAL Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause that provides the reason or cause of the fact stated in the independent clause. TEMPORAL Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause that indicates an act or state that occurs prior to, at the same time as, or subsequent to the act or state of the main clause. COMPARATIVE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause that follows the comparative form of an adjective or adverb. PURPOSE Corresponds to a kind of adverbial clause expressing purpose (commonly referred to in linguistics as final clause ). SUJECT_OBJECT Corresponds to a kind of subordinate noun clause acting as subject or object of the preposition NON_FINITE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate noun clause whose verb is non-finite. CONDITIONAL Corresponds to a kind of subordinate noun clause expressing factual implications, or hypothetical situations and their consequences (introduced by if ). CONSECUTIVE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause which expresses the result of the action stated in the main clause or a preceding sentence. CONCESSIVE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause which expresses an opposite idea compared to the main clause ADVERSATIVE Corresponds to a kind of subordinate clause which expresses an event or situation that is opposite to that of the main clause (introduced by but ). PARENTHETIC Corresponds to a kind of clause, often explanatory or qualifying, inserted into a passage with which it is not grammatically connected, and marked off by brackets, dashes, etc. Blank tile Denotes text portions that are not real clauses. Example Considering the sentence : If you are a whiskey lover, you will know that it is a spirit produced from fermented grain and aged in the wood. The disambiguator labels the tiles in the clause layer as follows: If you are a whiskey lover = CONDITIONAL you will know = INDEPENDENT that it is a spirit = SUBJECT_OBJECT produced from fermented grain = RELATIVE and aged in the wood = RELATIVE Clause tile details are: The clause text. The clause ID, that is the clause position within the detected clause sequence. The clause type. Interpret phrase tiles The labels of the tiles in the phrase layer represent the phrase type: Type Description AP Adjective Phrase CP Conjunction Phrase CR Blank lines DP Adverb Phrase NA Not Applicable (usually indicates punctuation) NP Noun Phrase PN Nominal Predicate PP Preposition Phrase RP Relative Phrase VP Verb Phrase Example Considering again the sentence above, the disambiguator labels the tiles in the phrase layer as follows: If = CP you = NP are a whiskey lover = PN , = Blank tile you = NP will know = VP that = CP it = NP is a spirit = PN produced = VP from fermented grain = PP and = CP aged = VP in the wood = PP . = Blank tile Phrase tile details are: The phrase text. The phrase type. Interpret word tiles The tiles in the word layer correspond to the largest possible spans of text identified by the disambiguator as having a distinct meaning. A tile can correspond to a single word like consciousness \u2014also hyphenated like high-density \u2014, a multi-word collocation like Artificial Intelligence , or punctuation. Some tiles directly correspond to a Knowledge Graph concept\u2014a Knowledge Graph's syncon\u2014, other are \"unknown\", but recognized by the disambiguator as \"type of\" a known concept, the so called virtual syncon . Tile labels represent the part of speech tags. When the underlying text is also recognized as an entity (for example a person name, a date, a measure and so on), the entity type is appended to the grammar type, separated by a dot: grammar_type.entity_type Example NPR.NPH is the label for a tile corresponding to a proper name that's also person name, like John Smith . Please see to the expert.ai languages reference for the list of part of speech entity type labels. Tile details vary based on the grammar type. Example Considering the sentence: Phillipe Starck has teamed up with a longstanding collaborator, Italian furniture company Kartell, to create the first chair to be designed using artificial intelligence, which is aptly named A.I. teamed up is labeled as VER (verb) and its details are: Name Value Text teamed up Base form team up Grammar type VER Tense Present perfect Cont Not continuous Person 3 Syncon #70621 Parent 1 #70624, group, aggroup Parent data refers to concepts that, in the Knowledge Graph supernomen-subnomen or superverbum-subverbum hierarchy, depending on the grammar type, are \"the parent\" of the tile concept. Interpret atom tiles Tiles in the atom layer must be interpreted as those of the word layer (see above) and have the same functionalities, with the difference that they cannot represent collocations, but only single component words. Interpret text elements tiles Each tile in the text elements layer represents the portion of text corresponding to the atom tile above it. Tiles in this layer have the same functionalities of those in the atom layer. Common functionalities of lower layers tiles Tiles in the word, atom and text elements layers have the same functionalities. Tile details are: The item text. The base form or lemma . Grammar features like type, gender, number. In the details panel: To copy the type, right-click one of the rows and choose Copy Type .

To search the Knowledge Graph using the lemma as search criteria, right-click one of the rows and choose Find lemma in Knowledge Graph . Tiles corresponding to a concept The tiles in the word, atom and text elements layers that represent a Knowledge Graph concept have more details and functionalities. Know the syncon ID If Toggle Syncons IDs is off and you need to know the Knowledge Graph's syncon ID: Right-click the tile. The syncon ID appears in the title of the context menu. Or: Select the tile. The syncon ID appears among the details on the right. Copy the syncon ID Right-click the tile and choose Copy ID . Or: Select the tile.

In the details panel, double-click the row with the syncon ID. Show tags The tags applied\u2014by rules or by scripts\u2014above the disambiguation output are visually represented as the labels of tiles in the word and atom layers. You can recognize the tiles representing tags because their label has a triple red underline. In particular, the grammar type of the tag takes the place of the label of the tile in the word layer and the tag label takes the place of the label of the tile in the atom layer. Tags are shown by default. To decide if and which tags to display, choose from Tagger list on the toolbar.

Rules and scripts are to be written inside text files with specific extensions: rules files have the .cr extension, scripts have the .jr extension. Both types of files are kept in the rules folder of the project structure . Default code Each project created from scratch contains the code of a minimal sample text intelligence engine. This engine is capable of categorization and extraction. Three files are automatically created inside the rules folder: config.cr : a rules file containing sample declarations of sections, segments and a template-field couple for extraction. main.cr : a rules file containing an IMPORT statement that includes the config.cr file and two very simple rules, one for categorization and the other for extraction. main.jr : a script containing event handling functions. The project also has a pre-defined sample taxonomy inside the taxonomy.xml file. The sample categorization rule in the main.cr file refers to a category defined in that taxonomy file. Replace the default code with your own. Main files main.cr is the main rules file. You must write all your rules inside it or have your rules split in several .cr files provided that you use the IMPORT statement to include those files in the main.cr file. Inclusion can be recursive. For example, you can make main.jr include files a.cr and b.cr , then include file a-a.cr in a.cr and so on. Please refer to the IMPORT statement documentation for further information. config.cr is a convenient, but non-essential, file to write project-wide definitions and options. In the event your project does not require these, the default code may be moved to main.cr and the file can be removed. main.jr is the main scripting file. The default file already contains the declarations of the expert.ai Script event handler functions . You can put your scripting code in that file or use other files, but, in that case, you must structure the code in those files as scripting modules and use statement like: var regexMod = require('modules/regexcleaner'); in the main.jr file to reference them. Sub-folders If you decide to divide your rules and your scripts among multiple files, you can organize these files as you wish in sub-folders of the rules directory. See the pages dedicated to the topic to know how to create and manage files and folders . Write rules code The following pages in this section illustrate the main tools available for writing rules and scripts. You can write rules from scratch using the Rules language or you can start from rule templates . Smart completion helps you write code faster and make fewer mistakes. Whenever you need to specify syncons or lemmas in your statements, you can use Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Graph Search . If you want to check syncons and lemmas that are already in the code, use the Knowledge Graph lookup commands. You can also get quick information on a syncon indicated in the code. IntelliJ IDEA provides powerful search-and-replace features . Tip Add comments to your code. The experience of many programmers teaches that the time spent commenting the code is largely saved when the program has to be maintained. Read the page dedicated to the topic to learn how to do it. As you write code, these features can also help: Line numbers and bookmarks Soft wrap Reformatting Code folding and regions Code selection Studio provides several useful ways to select code. Discover them on the page dedicated to this topic. Add and delete lines To add a line after the current one, press Shift+Enter . To add a line before the current one, press Ctrl+Alt+Enter . To duplicate a line, press Ctrl+D . To delete a line, press Ctrl+Y . Auto-save Studio automatically saves files as a consequence of these actions: Build Analysis & debug Version control operations Closing a file or a project Quitting the IDE To change the auto-save behavior: Select File > Settings > Appearance and Behavior > System Settings . Set the auto-save parameters in the Synchronization area. Info To save all the changed files at once whenever you need to: Select File > Save All on the main menu. Or: Press Ctrl+S . Undo and redo changes To undo changes: Press Ctrl-Z Or: Select Edit > Undo on the main menu. To redo changes: Press Ctrl-Shift-Z Or: Select Edit > Redo on the main menu. For more sophisticated change management, you can use the local history (see below) or a VCS . Local history Local history keeps track of local file changes without requiring a VCS. This allows seeing the chronology of the changes for rules files and script files. It also allows rolling back a file to any previous stage. Caution Local history is limited in terms of time and size. By default, it is configured to store changes for the last 5 working days. For more information on the local history functionality and the ways to compare and restore versions, see the IntelliJ IDEA documentation . View local history Open or select the file in the editor.

With VCS, changes are tracked and attributed to the users who made them in order to decide which, between potentially conflicting changes, are to be accepted and which discarded.

In particular, for each line you can see the version in which the line originated, the ID of the last user who committed the line and the time of the last commit. In other words, VCS annotations help finding out who did what and when, in order to \"trace back the culprit\".

Please refer to the IntelliJ IDEA documentation\u2014also accessible through the Studio Help menu \u2014for all the other aspects of the UI. Layout This is what the UI looks like: The file editor is the main area where to modify the files. Along the edge there are numerous tool windows , most of them are minimized. Opened tool windows occupy part of the workspace around the editor.

Navigation bar The navigation bar is a compact navigation alternative to the project tree view available in the Project tool window . Like the breadcrumbs feature of many Web sites, it displays the in-project relative path of the current file or folder which can be either the file selected in the editor or the file/folder selected in the Project tool window. Clicking on a folder along the path lets you choose a file to open or a sub-folder to navigate to. It is available also a context menu composed of the IntelliJ IDEA commands and the specific Studio New command that allows you to create project files types that are consistent with the nature of the folder. For example,in the rules folder\u2014dedicated to rules and script files\u2014you can create a Test File, a Rules file, a List file or a Script file. Tool windows Tool windows allow examining the results of the last project run, debugging scripts, managing certain types of files more easily than with the editor, and more.

By default, tool windows are attached to the bottom and to the sides of the main window, but they can be rearranged and even detached and used as separate windows. Please refer to the IntelliJ IDEA guide to tool windows for a complete description of the common aspects an functionalities. The following topics in this section of the manual describe all the relevant tool windows in detail. Here follows a description of functionalities and elements that are common to all or most windows. Quick access controls A single click on the tool window selector on the edge of the Studio window opens the tool window. Hovering over the button at the left of the Studio status bar displays the list of the tool windows. The same button also acts as a visibility toggle switch for tool windows selectors: a single mouse click hides or displays all the tool windows selectors. Some tool windows can receive focus by pressing Alt and a number shown in the list of tool windows. For example, Alt-2 sets the focus to the Favorites tool window. Info Keyboard shortcuts are re-configurable, so you can associate a keyboard shortcut to Studio proprietary tool windows if you wish. Title bar When a tool window is open, the title bar contains these buttons on the right: Icon Name Description Open the relevant help topic in this manual (For some tool windows only) Float the tool window (For some tool windows only) Dock the tool window Show Option Menu Control tool window appearance Hide Minimize the tool window Show Option Menu shows a menu with commands to: Change view mode Move or resize the window Remove the tool window tab Info If a tool window tab is removed, it can be restored by selecting it on the View > Tool Windows menu. The title bar has a context menu with the same commands of the Show Option Menu plus the minimize command. Depending on the window, the title bar can contain tabs corresponding to window panels. In this case, the title bar context menu also contains commands to navigate and group the tabs. Current context Some tool windows have an area under the title bar showing the name of the current project module. If the window displays the results of the last run for a test file, the name of that file is shown too, together with the Select Source File button that allows selecting the file in the editor. In this area, for the Extraction and the Categorization tool windows only, could appear the following icons: Icon Description Rules have been modified and code snippet could be wrong Project has been rebuilt since last analysis Contents The contents of a tool window can be organized into one or multiple panels, all of which can be arranged as tabs. Further, each panel can contain sub-panels which can be similarly organized The empty space between panels normally acts as a draggable resize control. Toolbar Tool window panels have a toolbar usually located at the top of the panel, but there can be exceptions depending on the tool window nature and functionality. Toolbar commands are panel-specific, however commands with the same name and icon perform a similar action in every panel of every tool window. For example, panels that display a hierarchy of elements usually have toolbar commands to fully expand or collapse the hierarchy. In most cases, toolbar commands may also be accessed from the main menu, from context menu or may correspond to a keyboard shortcut.

It's also integrated with the Semantic Analysis tool window where it allows checking the disambiguation of text tokens. The window contains three strips, from top to bottom: Blue, \"left-linked syncons\" strip Red, Syncons strip Green, \"right-linked syncons\" strip The entire colored band and the Expand and Collapse button on the left of each strip act as toggle switches to turn on and off the full window display of the strip. Syncons strip The central Syncons strip is identified by the red vertical band on the left. After a search it shows the syncons that directly correspond to the search criteria while after a double-click on a syncon in another strip it shows the selected syncon. Info From now on, current syncon will be used to refer to the syncon that's selected in the Syncons strip. Blue strip The \"left-linked syncons\" strip is the first strip from the top and is identified by the blue vertical band on its left. It shows single syncons or\u2014when the full hierarchy view is activated\u2014syncon lists that are linked with current syncon in the left direction along the link that's selected in the toolbar's Link drop-down list. The strip name is the name of the left part of the link. For example, if the link is supernomen/subnomen , the strip is named Supernomen and shows syncons that are ancestors of the current syncon in the supernomen/subnomen hierarchy. Green strip The \"right-linked syncons\" strip is the third strip from the top and is identified by the green vertical band on its left. It shows single syncons that are linked with current syncon in the right direction along the link that's selected in the toolbar's Link drop-down list. The strip name is the name of the right part of the link. For example, if the link is supernomen/subnomen , the strip is named Subnomen and shows syncons that are descendants of the current syncon in the supernomen/subnomen hierarchy. Row items Rows in every strip have the same fields and controls. They correspond to these columns: Name Description Lemmas Syncon lemmas or\u2014in the blue strip, when the full hierarchy view is activated\u2014syncon lists with their lemmas F Syncon frequency W Syncon weight Domains Knowledge domains the syncon belongs to, with relevance expressed as a percentage ID Syncon identification number Pin Base Knowledge Graph pin toggle switch When the advanced pin mode is activated via the the toolbar toggle switch, the Pin columns is replaced by these columns: Icon Name Wikipedia Custom Knowledge Graph Base Knowledge Graph Geonames IMDB Authors IMDB Titles Deprecated Knowledge Graph These columns contain pin toggle switches for syncon IDs corresponding to specific or custom Knowledge Graph sections. Lemmas field By default, the Lemmas field shows the syncon lemmas separated by comma. In the blue strip, when the full hierarchy view is activated, Lemmas shows a syncon list composed by the names of all the ancestors of the current syncon\u2014its ancestry . In this case, the names of the ancestors are separated by a double right angle quote sign ( \u00bb ). If the window is too small to show all the items in a row, the list is truncated and the number of items that are not displayed is shown at the end of the list prefixed by the plus sign ( + ). Expand/collapse toggle switch At the beginning of each row, there's an expand/collapse toggle switch. By default, it displays or hides syncon lemmas with their details that include: Extra information\u2014marked with a E letter on a gray background Register information\u2014marked with a R letter on a gray background Lemma frequency in the F column Lemma weight in the W column In the blue strip, when the full hierarchy view is activated, it displays or hides the syncons of the selected ancestry. In the context of the single syncon, it has again the function of turning on and off the display of single lemmas with their details. Part-of-speech symbol To the right of the expand/collapse toggle, there's a symbol. It identifies the part-of-speech. Possible symbols and corresponding parts-of-speech are: Icon Part-of-speech Common noun Proper noun Verb Adjective Adverb Toolbar Icon Name Description Go Back and Go Forward Go back and forth in the search history. Search box and list Specify the search criteria. Find Start a search. Match Case When activated, results must match the case of the search criteria. Links list Knowledge graph links. After a search, only the links the current syncon belongs to are shown. Full Hierarchy View Turns the complete ancestry display on or off for the current syncon in the left-linked syncons strip. Save Hierarchy Report Create a report containing the syncon hierarchy. Custom Data View Turn on and off the display of additional information about the current syncon in the Custom Data panel that appears in the right part of the Syncons strip. Toggle Advanced Pin Mode When activated, additional columns are shown on the right of the strips to allow for pinning not only the syncons but also custom data. Clear Clear the results, the search box and the list of pinned items, but not the search history. The Search box is where the search criteria must be specified.

A double-click on a item in the Syncons strip act as a toggle swith to pin or unpin the item itself. A double-click on a syncon in one of the two \"linked syncons\" strips makes the selected syncon become the new current syncon. It is displayed in the Syncons strip and the other strips are updated to show syncons that are linked with the new current syncon. Pinned Syncons and Lemmas pane The Pinned Syncons and Lemmas pane allows managing pinned syncons. The pane appears after the first pinning action and disappears when all pinned syncons have been unpinned.
